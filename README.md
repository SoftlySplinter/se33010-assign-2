SE33010 Assignment Two
======================

This is the second of two SE33010 practical assignments. It will count for 10% of the total marks for the course. You should spend no more than eight hours of effort on this assignment.

**Deadline:** You **must** submit your assignment via SafeAssign on Blackboard before the deadline of **4:00pm on Tuesday, 23rd April**. You may submit your assignment via SafeAssign at any time up to the deadline.

For information about submitting an assignment via SafeAssign see: http://nexus.aber.ac.uk/xwiki/bin/download/Main/safeassign/SafeAssignguidestudent2012new.pdf

**N.B. Please ensure that you click the Submit button after you have attached our assignment to Blackboard**. If you do not click the Submit button the upload process will not be completed and your assignment will be lost.

Notes:

1. If you cannot submit the assignment via SafeAssign, you must make alternative arrangements with me (or, exceptionally, with another member of staff) **before** the deadline.
2. If you submit work other than via SafeAssign, you must ensure that the work is dated and a receipt obtained.
3. Work which is submitted after the deadline, without prior permission (which is rarely given), will receive no marks. If you do hand in your work after the deadline, please also submit a “Late Assignment” form explaining why the work was handed in late. 
4. If you feel that you have a very good reason for submitting your work late, you must seek the permission of the year co-ordinator (Neil Taylor nst@aber.ac.uk) before the deadline for submitting the work. In almost all cases you will be told to submit the work, in an incomplete state, by the deadline, and complete a Special Circumstances Form explaining the circumstances that made it impossible for you to complete the work, which must be accompanied by supporting evidence.

Imagine that you are a recent recruit to a small, but rapidly expanding and go-ahead, software house that uses a traditional paper-based spiral development process with Java as its main programming language. The managing director has asked you to write a brief report discussing what changes would need to be made to the company’s software
development process if a model-based formal specification language were to be introduced.

Write that report.

Note that, since the managing director is very busy, your report should occupy no more than two sides of A4. It should be easy to read, well structured, and clearly set out the points you are making.

This assignment will be assessed using the “Assessment Criteria for Essays”.

See the Student Handbook, Appendix AC, via the URL: http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Dept/Teaching/Handbook/AppendixAC.pdf

A few marks (about 2 out of 10) will be given for presentation and style.

**N.B.** SafeAssign accepts files in `.doc`, `.docx`, `.rtf`, `.odt`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.html` formats.

Marks will be deducted if you submit more than two sides of A4.

To avoid problems with Word reformatting your document and changing the pagination, I suggest that you submit your assignment in PDF.

Please make sure that there is some personal identification on your submission. This does not have to be your name, your student number is sufficient.

**Deadline:** You **must** submit your assignment via SafeAssign on Blackboard before the deadline of **4:00pm on Tuesday, 23rd April**. You may submit your assignment via SafeAssign at any time up to the deadline.

**N.B. Please ensure that you click the Submit button after you have attached your assignment to Blackboard**. If you do not click the Submit button the upload process will not be completed and your assignment will be lost.
