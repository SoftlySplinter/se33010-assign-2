abstract={A short description is given of software process models and the issues they address. An outline is given of the process steps involved in the spiral model, an evolving risk-driven approach that provides a framework for guiding the software process, and its application to a software project is shown. A summary is given of the primary advantages and implications involved in using the spiral model and the primary difficulties in using it at its current incomplete level of elaboration.<>},
